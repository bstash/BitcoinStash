===========

Bitcoin Stash is a cryptocurrency that is hard forked from Bitcoin Cash. We are a group of former Bitcoin Cash developers and community members that have become dismayed at the current outlook of BCH. It utilizes merge mining to solve the problem of bad actors attempting to hijack the chain and performing 51% attacks with minimal effort.
